# proj-viz-exp

A webapp that offers brilliant, vibe-coded visual experiences. This one drops you into a dark, purple fantasy lava cave with glowing crystal accents and a molten ribbon that circles the view. The experience is static and front-end only—no build step or backend required.

## Running locally

Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder with any static file server.

## Viewing notes
- This workspace cannot host a public URL, so view it locally.
- Quick open: double-click `index.html` (or use a file URL like `file:///path/to/proj-viz-exp/index.html`).
- Local server (recommended):
  - `cd proj-viz-exp`
  - `python -m http.server 8000`
  - Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
- For the intended vibe, view it full-screen or in a large window so the circling lava ribbon fills the frame.

## Project log location
- Session prompts and outcomes are recorded in `logs/steps.md` for traceability of what was asked and what was delivered.
